### **Phase 1: Familiarization with C++ and Competitive Programming Basics (21 Days)**
#### **Goal:** Master C++ syntax, STL, and basic CP concepts.
1. **Daily Schedule:**
   - **2 hours:** C++ syntax and basics (focus on arrays, strings, functions, pointers, etc.).
   - **2 hours:** STL (Standard Template Library) essentials:
     - `vector`, `map`, `set`, `pair`, and iterators.
     - Sorting with `sort()`, using `lower_bound()` and `upper_bound()`.
   - **2 hours:** Solve beginner-level problems on Codeforces or other platforms like CodeChef/LeetCode.

2. **Resources:**
   - **C++ Tutorials:** Watch free YouTube tutorials for STL (e.g., CodeNCode, Striver).
   - **Problems:** Solve `A` and `B` problems on Codeforces Div. 2 contests.
   - Practice from the **Competitive Programmer's Handbook** (Chapter 1–4).

3. **Outcome:** 
   - You’ll be comfortable with basic C++ programming and STL usage.

### **Phase 2: Mastering Problem-Solving Techniques (Months 1–3)**
#### **Goal:** Build strong foundations in DSA and problem-solving.
1. **Daily Schedule (6 Hours):**
   - **2 hours:** Learn a topic from DSA (pick one per week). Examples:
     - Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching (Week 1–4).
     - Recursion, Backtracking, Prefix Sums, Binary Search (Week 5–8).
   - **2 hours:** Solve problems related to the weekly topic on Codeforces or platforms like AtCoder, HackerRank.
   - **2 hours:** Participate in virtual contests or solve recent Codeforces contests.

2. **Focus Areas:**
   - **Mathematics:** Modular arithmetic, GCD/LCM, combinatorics, prime numbers.
   - **Implementation:** Practice edge-case handling, debugging.
   - **Algorithms:** Learn and practice algorithms like Kadane's for subarray sums, sliding window, and binary search.

3. **Resources:**
   - **DSA Tutorials:** Striver’s DSA sheet, CodeNCode YouTube series.
   - **Books:** Continue with the **Competitive Programmer’s Handbook** (focus on algorithms and data structures).

4. **Outcome:**
   - You’ll be comfortable with beginner and intermediate DSA concepts and can solve Div. 2 `A`, `B`, and some `C` problems.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Problem Solving and Regular Contest Participation (Months 4–8)**
#### **Goal:** Learn advanced algorithms and increase contest performance.
1. **Daily Schedule:**
   - **2 hours:** Learn advanced topics like:
     - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, MST).
     - Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques.
     - Bit Manipulation.
   - **2 hours:** Solve problems based on learned topics (start solving Div. 2 `C`, `D` problems).
   - **2 hours:** Participate in Codeforces contests and analyze solutions post-contest.

2. **Practice Strategy:**
   - Solve problems from sorted lists by difficulty (e.g., on Codeforces using tags).
   - Learn from editorial solutions for problems you couldn’t solve.

3. **Resources:**
   - **Graph and DP Tutorials:** WilliamFiset (YouTube), Codeforces blogs.
   - **Practice Sites:** CSES Problem Set, AtCoder, Codeforces Gym.

4. **Outcome:**
   - You can solve Div. 2 `C`, `D`, and some `E` problems and begin competing in Div. 1 contests.

---

### **Phase 4: Becoming an Expert (Months 9–12)**
#### **Goal:** Fine-tune competitive programming skills and consistently perform in contests.
1. **Daily Schedule:**
   - **2 hours:** Revise weak areas and topics from contests.
   - **2 hours:** Solve hard problems (`D` and `E`) from previous contests.
   - **2 hours:** Regular participation in contests (Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef Long).

2. **Key Strategies:**
   - Practice speed and accuracy during contests.
   - Focus on time management and reading problem statements quickly.
   - Study top-rated participants’ solutions and approaches.

3. **Resources:**
   - **Codeforces Blogs:** Read about advanced topics like centroid decomposition, FFT.
   - **Problem Archives:** Solve from past contests in your rating range.

4. **Outcome:**
   - You should consistently perform well in Div. 1 contests and achieve the expert rating.

### **General Tips**
1. **Consistency is Key:** Practice daily and aim for incremental improvement.
2. **Analyze Contests:** Post-contest analysis is crucial. Understand why you couldn’t solve certain problems.
3. **Join a Community:** Engage in CP communities for motivation (e.g., Codeforces forums, Discord servers).
4. **Track Progress:** Use tools like StopStalk or CF Tracker to monitor your problem-solving history.

With 6 hours daily, focus, and consistent practice, achieving an expert rating on Codeforces in 2025 is realistic.
