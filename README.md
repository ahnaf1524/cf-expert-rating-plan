# Faq
### **1. How Much Time to Spend on Problems**
- **A and B Problems (Easy):**
  - Spend **15–20 minutes** if you're stuck.
  - These problems need basic skills or simple tricks. If you're stuck, look for hints or try again after solving other problems.
- **C and D Problems (Medium):**
  - Spend **30–45 minutes** if you're stuck.
  - These problems need more thinking or small tricks with data structures. Break the problem into smaller steps.
- **E and F Problems (Hard):**
  - Spend **1–1.5 hours** if you're stuck.
  - These problems are harder and need advanced knowledge. Don’t spend too long if you can’t solve them.

---

### **2. When to Look at the Solution**
1. **If You Have No Idea:**
   - After the time is up, read hints or explanations—not the full code.
   - Understand the method first, then write the solution yourself.
2. **If You’re Close to Solving:**
   - If you’re stuck on small parts, look at only those parts of the solution.
   - Write the full solution yourself afterward to remember it better.
3. **If You’re Totally Stuck:**
   - After trying hard, it’s okay to look at the full code.
   - Study it, then write the solution on your own to learn from it.

---

### **3. Learn After Seeing the Solution**
- **Step 1:** Understand the Idea:
   - Focus on *why* the solution works and what you missed.
- **Step 2:** Write It Again:
   - Write the solution yourself without copying.
- **Step 3:** Solve More Problems:
   - Find 2–3 similar problems with the same idea and solve them.

---

### **4. Long-Term Plan**
- **Easy Problems:** Solve by yourself unless you’re really stuck.
- **Medium Problems:** Only check solutions after you try hard and still can’t solve them.
- **Hard Problems:** Learn from the solution if you don’t know the concept, and use it as a chance to learn.

---

### **Tips for Thinking**
1. **Be Active:** Don’t just stare at the problem. Try examples, draw things, or write down ideas.
2. **Set a Timer:** If you’re stuck for too long, move to another problem. Don’t waste too much time.
3. **Work Quickly:** Spend less time on problems you know and more time on new ideas.
