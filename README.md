### **Phase 3: Advanced Problem Solving and Regular Contest Participation (Months 4–8)**
#### **Goal:** Learn advanced algorithms and increase contest performance.
1. **Daily Schedule:**
   - **2 hours:** Learn advanced topics like:
     - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, MST).
     - Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques.
     - Bit Manipulation.
   - **2 hours:** Solve problems based on learned topics (start solving Div. 2 `C`, `D` problems).
   - **2 hours:** Participate in Codeforces contests and analyze solutions post-contest.

2. **Practice Strategy:**
   - Solve problems from sorted lists by difficulty (e.g., on Codeforces using tags).
   - Learn from editorial solutions for problems you couldn’t solve.

3. **Resources:**
   - **Graph and DP Tutorials:** WilliamFiset (YouTube), Codeforces blogs.
   - **Practice Sites:** CSES Problem Set, AtCoder, Codeforces Gym.

4. **Outcome:**
   - You can solve Div. 2 `C`, `D`, and some `E` problems and begin competing in Div. 1 contests.

---

### **Phase 4: Becoming an Expert (Months 9–12)**
#### **Goal:** Fine-tune competitive programming skills and consistently perform in contests.
1. **Daily Schedule:**
   - **2 hours:** Revise weak areas and topics from contests.
   - **2 hours:** Solve hard problems (`D` and `E`) from previous contests.
   - **2 hours:** Regular participation in contests (Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef Long).

2. **Key Strategies:**
   - Practice speed and accuracy during contests.
   - Focus on time management and reading problem statements quickly.
   - Study top-rated participants’ solutions and approaches.

3. **Resources:**
   - **Codeforces Blogs:** Read about advanced topics like centroid decomposition, FFT.
   - **Problem Archives:** Solve from past contests in your rating range.

4. **Outcome:**
   - You should consistently perform well in Div. 1 contests and achieve the expert rating.

### **General Tips**
1. **Consistency is Key:** Practice daily and aim for incremental improvement.
2. **Analyze Contests:** Post-contest analysis is crucial. Understand why you couldn’t solve certain problems.
3. **Join a Community:** Engage in CP communities for motivation (e.g., Codeforces forums, Discord servers).
4. **Track Progress:** Use tools like StopStalk or CF Tracker to monitor your problem-solving history.

With 6 hours daily, focus, and consistent practice, achieving an expert rating on Codeforces in 2025 is realistic.
# Faq
### **1. How Much Time to Spend on Problems**
- **A and B Problems (Easy):**
  - Spend **15–20 minutes** if you're stuck.
  - These problems need basic skills or simple tricks. If you're stuck, look for hints or try again after solving other problems.
- **C and D Problems (Medium):**
  - Spend **30–45 minutes** if you're stuck.
  - These problems need more thinking or small tricks with data structures. Break the problem into smaller steps.
- **E and F Problems (Hard):**
  - Spend **1–1.5 hours** if you're stuck.
  - These problems are harder and need advanced knowledge. Don’t spend too long if you can’t solve them.

---

### **2. When to Look at the Solution**
1. **If You Have No Idea:**
   - After the time is up, read hints or explanations—not the full code.
   - Understand the method first, then write the solution yourself.
2. **If You’re Close to Solving:**
   - If you’re stuck on small parts, look at only those parts of the solution.
   - Write the full solution yourself afterward to remember it better.
3. **If You’re Totally Stuck:**
   - After trying hard, it’s okay to look at the full code.
   - Study it, then write the solution on your own to learn from it.

---

### **3. Learn After Seeing the Solution**
- **Step 1:** Understand the Idea:
   - Focus on *why* the solution works and what you missed.
- **Step 2:** Write It Again:
   - Write the solution yourself without copying.
- **Step 3:** Solve More Problems:
   - Find 2–3 similar problems with the same idea and solve them.

---

### **4. Long-Term Plan**
- **Easy Problems:** Solve by yourself unless you’re really stuck.
- **Medium Problems:** Only check solutions after you try hard and still can’t solve them.
- **Hard Problems:** Learn from the solution if you don’t know the concept, and use it as a chance to learn.

---

### **Tips for Thinking**
1. **Be Active:** Don’t just stare at the problem. Try examples, draw things, or write down ideas.
2. **Set a Timer:** If you’re stuck for too long, move to another problem. Don’t waste too much time.
3. **Work Quickly:** Spend less time on problems you know and more time on new ideas.
